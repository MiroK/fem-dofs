The kiss principle says 'Look at the Legendre mass matrix'
Maybe DG does not need -1, 1 and that's better

Assamble matrices on mesh

Interpolate and verify - KISS no function spaces etc in the first round

Iterative solvers: Jacobi, Richardson, Gauss-Seidel, SOR (round 0) [OK]
                   add preconditioners
                   extracting diagonal [OK]

Multigrid

Circle constuction

-laplace(u) with deltas ...
