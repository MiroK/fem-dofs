The kiss principle says 'Look at the Legendre mass matrix' [The basis Pk does
not matter. It makes it easy/difficult to construct the Lagrange interpolants
but it is the matrix of Lagrange interpol. polys that matters for conditioning]


Assamble matrices on mesh[OK]
Interpolate and verify - KISS no function spaces etc in the first round [OK]
Iterative solvers: Jacobi, Richardson, Gauss-Seidel, SOR (round 0) [OK]
                   extracting diagonal [OK]
                   add preconditioners [Nofix]

SUMMER:

>> Multigrid - Luke Olson wrote some paper on this in SJSC

>> Circle constuction

>> -laplace(u) with deltas ... that's something which points to points source
                            problems

>> The idea about points determining goodness of delta approximations

>> On reference element we have M, but is there a difference for A, A+M,
   convection diffusion problem with groving velocity? Carry this to mesh
   computations

>> For an element we can drop the requirement to have (-1, 1). How does that
   change things for all the matrices. Also, for mesh we will need DG
   implementation stuff - jump, avg etc...

>> Get the papers from Desktop 4 and more

>> Write the observations and ideas !!!

>> Unstructured in 1d has effect? Some '--'-' refine is probably easiest anisot

>> Hermite in 1d, order 3 + higher by bubbles [OK, done]

>> 2d rect or tri.

>> Then there are interesting questions: in addition to A, M, A+M convection
   diffusion you have mixed Laplacian, Stokes, Elasticity

>> I think the answer is continuouos then discrete to matrix level. Think about
>> what the condition number mirrors. You saw in 1d that you can get different
   condition number but there is no visible effect in the error so that's not
   the relation.

>> Hermite: Bubbles - Poisson[OK]
            Biharmonic - requires bending matrix...
